# E-core Backend Challenge 20230712

## Introduction

Hello! Thank you for your interest in this position. Before the final interview, we would like to see an example of your work.

In this challenge, there are several ways to develop and obtain the proposed results. The objective is to evaluate its form of structuring and autonomy in decisions to build something scalable.

## Challenge / Case

This project is a Java SpringBoot microservice that spins up a REST API, called Roles API, to improve upon the capabilities of the Users API and the Teams API to manage memberships between them. The project is covered by unit tests and API tests.
The microservice is exposed via a REST Api. For more info check-out the exposed OpenApi (checkout the README for more info) under <host>:<port>/swagger-ui.html

## Step by step

The code you are receiving may contain flaws such as: code smells, bad practices, bad/wrong/missing tests, bad/missing validations, and so on.
One of the tasks is to find the problems in the code.

Fix them as soon as you find them, and describe the error with the correction in the PR description.
For issues you don't have time to fix, mention them in the PR description with the fix you would like to have implemented.

The other task is to implement a new API endpoint where the user can get a Role using userId and teamId as filters.

**Remember to add Unit Tests and API Tests for it. Add a comment in your PR explaining what was your approach for the new API endpoint.**

###  Must have

- A public PR containing all the changes;
- Your public PR should contain a detailed description:
  - You should mention and justify every change you did on the code;
  - You should describe your approach to implement the new endpoint;
- You should implement tests for the new endpoint;
- The entire code, README, and any supporting documentation should be
  written in English.

### We will look for experience and good practices with:
- Tests!
- Code review;
- Project patterns and clean code;
- Business validations;
- Implementing a new feature following the existing project standard;
- Creating a PR.
